Climate change and population growth make the world's water woes more urgent, says Simon Long

Water: Climate change and population growth are making the world's water woes more urgent
Rivers and lakes: Poisoned and over-exploited, many rivers are in a parlous state
Water conflicts: Disputes over water will be an increasing source of international tension
Groundwater: Groundwater is helping to feed the world, but it is dangerously depleted
Saving water: The best way to solve the world's water woes is to use less of it
Desalination: Manufactured water can supplement the natural stuff, but never replace it
Conclusion: Water, the original solvent, can provide its own solutions
